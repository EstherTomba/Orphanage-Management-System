                    <p>
                    Cottolengo Centre started in 1994, with the aim of taking care of vulnerable abandoned and orphaned children, who are either infected or affected by HIV+ from all Kenya and  preferably from Nairobi. 
                The Centre is managed by the Cottolengo Sisters here in Kenya. Cottolengo Centre is a Catholic Faith-Based nonprofit making institution.
                Cottolengo Centre admits mainly infant children under one year of age who are HIV positive. 
                There are exceptions for admission and the staff considers the needs of each child.

                    Health care: The need for health care includes childhood immunizations and vitamin supplements 
                    for children under five, routine health care for all and reproductive health services for older 
                    children aged 10â€“17. In some countries health care is free for all children or for the 
                    youngest children. However, patients often have to pay for drugs and supplies. Some have argued that orphan-related programmes should advocate for free health care for all children rather than focus on providing funding to pay for care for children. However, in that case additional resources 
                    would need to be made available to governments to provide free care to families.
