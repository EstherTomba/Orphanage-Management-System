                    Health care: The need for health care includes childhood immunizations and vitamin supplements 
                    for children under five, routine health care for all and reproductive health services for older 
                    children aged 10â€“17. In some countries health care is free for all children or for the 
                    youngest children. However, patients often have to pay for drugs and supplies. Some have argued that orphan-related programmes should advocate for free health care for all children rather than focus on providing funding to pay for care for children. However, in that case additional resources 
                    would need to be made available to governments to provide free care to families

                    Education: This includes school fees where they exist, funds required for uniforms, books and other supplies, and special fees. Many countries have eliminated school fees and additional advocacy efforts could help to eliminate them in other countries as well,
                     but the extra costs of uniforms, supplies and special assessments can still be substantial.

                    Other services: We have not explicitly included costs for national-level advocacy and legislative reform. 
                    These may be needed in many countries to address specific issues such as school fees, the cost of health care or child protection.
                     Also many important activities such as memory books, camps etc. are assumed to be covered under community support but these may require additional resources beyond the community worker training and support included here. 
                     We have included an estimate of the costs of administering support programmes including fund raising, planning, research etc.
                      This category applies to the organizational costs of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) providing support or central administration costs for government-run programmes.
