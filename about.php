                <p>
                Cottolengo Centre started in 1994, with the aim of taking care of vulnerable abandoned and orphaned children, who are either infected or affected by HIV+ from all Kenya and  preferably from Nairobi. 
                The Centre is managed by the Cottolengo Sisters here in Kenya. Cottolengo Centre is a Catholic Faith-Based nonprofit making institution.
                Cottolengo Centre admits mainly infant children under one year of age who are HIV positive. 
                There are exceptions for admission and the staff considers the needs of each child.
